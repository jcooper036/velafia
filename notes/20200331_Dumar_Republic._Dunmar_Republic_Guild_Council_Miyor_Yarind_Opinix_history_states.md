# The State Structure of Old Velafia
By the time of the Cataclysm, Old Velafia had transitioned from a system of city-states (identity based on localism) to one of nation states (identity based on cultural heritage / nationalism). During the Age of Isolation, the nations were splintered with the land, and what cities were not destroyed were isolated from one another. Once again, political and cultural identities reverted to that of a city.  

## Population Center Designations
As the Guild Council formed, they developed a way to classify population centers to the end of regulating trade and business. Though called different names in different cultures, the Guild Council operates on a uniform language to describe population centers. There are finer gradations, but these are the major ones:
- Village : less than 2,000 inhabitants. 
- Town : between 2,000 and 100,000 inhabitants. 
- City : at least 100,000 inhabitants. 
- Stronghold : less than 10,000 inhabitants, but fortification such that it's defensive capabilities are comparable to that of a city.
  
These criteria may seem odd, given that a town comprises such a large range. However, they are based on the distributions of population centers in modern Velafia. In any of these cases, something that doesn't technically meet the population criteria might fall into a different category if it otherwise posses many of the characteristics that are average to that category. For example, the city of !Opinix has only 78,000 inhabitants; it is called a city because it is wealthy, has historically been called a city, and remains the capital of the !Dumar_Republic.  

## State Center Designations
Since the reemergence, some cities have tried to unite long lost kin, some have taken the opportunity to form collations or empires, and some have decided that the best course of action is to remain concentrated. The !Guild_Council maintains a rating system for the size of different powers, as a way of setting taxes and fees appropriate to the ability of a state / power to pay them.  
- local power : one to two cities.
- regional power : two to four cities. The population, naval prominence, and total land area should be at least twice that of the average of all local powers.
- major power : more than 4 cities. The population, naval prominence, and total land area should be at least twice that of the average of all regional powers.
