# The major cultures of old Velafia
To understand the modern cultures of Velafia, it is important to understand the five major culture groups that pre-dated the Cataclysm. Though all people that come from the continent can be said to be "Velafian", there is no single culture that would call themselves that.

## Alailic (A-lay-lik)

## Krostea (Koss-tee-a)

## Chaturta (Sha-tur-tah)

## Betular (Bet-u-lar)

## Galtan (Gall-tan)
The Galtus basin was originally settled by a mixture of most races. Over the expansion period of the O.A., these people gravitated toward four Elven strongholds. In a similar parallel to Alailia, these settlers brought slaves with them, eventually leading to most elves emigrating away from the valley. However, the Galtian people system of slavery was very different from that of the Alialians. Where as in Alialian cities slavery was largely based on race (dwarves and orcs)


## Cyrenacian (Ky-ren-ay-ki-an) or (Sy-ren-ay-si-an), depending on where you are from

## Unur-Ken (un-ur-kehn)

## Sartosian

# Derivatives of these cultures in modern Velafia

# Interaction between Velafian and outside cultures

## Souther Elaria
