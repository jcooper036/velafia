# The Guild system of Velafia
Almost everything in modern Velafia revolves around the sea. Though powerful individuals have means of going place to place without sea travel, most goods and people take to the waves at some point in their existence. 

## The Guild Compact
During the early years of the reemergence, many enterprising individuals quickly realized that resource imbalance of the emerging state powers would pave the way to prosperity. In the vacuum of power, three industries came together with a stirring idea - if the emerging trade fleets, war galleys, and frontier explorers worked together, they could enshrine a legal system which would empower companies to operate under a unified set of laws on a multinational level. As such, in &4A.E., the Guild Compact was born. The Compact is a set of laws negotiated with all states (save !Moyr-Yind), which set baseline rules for the operation of trade, protection, and exploration. In the years to follow, other guilds were added to the Compact, including the Harvesters, Mages, and Envoys. The guild system is the closest thing that exists to a unified set of laws in !Velafia

## Charters
The essence of a guild is that they are permitted to issue **Charters**, par the laws of the Compact. A Charter is a legal document that can be owned by a company, a group, or and individual. It permits that entity certain legal rights and places certain legal restrictions on that entity when acting on behalf of the Charter.  
  
As the Reemergence has flourished, Charters have become more and more expensive to come by. It is now rare for individuals to possess a Charter - instead they are usually owned by companies or large groups.

## Banners
Though the guild system was not conceived with magic in mind, that did not stop mages throughout the land from seeing an opportunity to cement their political status and get rich in the process. In &11A.E. the great mage @Arlid came to the Guild Council with petition for the Mages to join as a member guild.   
  
That petition was in the form of a magic banner, which @Arlid and his colleges had imbued with some remarkable properties. The eight magical coords that striped the banner could record and recite a perfect record of their location and time in the world, as well as the proximity to all other banners within a mile. Not only this, but @Arlid demonstrated that any banner was really to be made from ten coords, two of which were to be kept by the mages for safekeeping. This would allow a mage to magically divine the location of any banner in the world, should they be asked to do so.  
  
The Mages proposed that they join under the the contract that they would produce and maintain the banners for all guilds. In turn, the guilds would issue banners to as part of a Charter to serve as the standards for ships and proof that someone was acting on the legal grounds of a guild charter. In disputes of breaking charters, banners provide key legal evidence as to the location and proximity to other banners. By this system, the guilds are able to enforce laws and revoke charters for bad actors.  
  
In &37A.E. the banner system was modified such that banners are only active when flying (either on a mast of a ship or a pole). This was to accommodate the rise of companies that desired to have vessels that could serve multiple purposes, and change that purpose based on what port they set out from. As such, a provision was added to the Guild Compact that ships are not allowed to change their banner(s) mid voyage. In &48A.E., with the expansion of the Mages Guild, they agreed to produce banners for states and companies that could pay for their production and upkeep. To facilitate this, the magical part of the banner are just the eight coords - the covering is usually cloth displaying the symbol or standard of the entity it represents. Banners are used so ubiquitously that they have become synonymous with terms like flag, standard, or colors.

In short, a banner:
- keeps a record of its position in space time as a permanent magical signature.
- is flown as the standard of a ship to identify which guild it sails under
- can be scryed upon via the coords that remain with the Mages Guild.
- can only be destroyed by magical means
- even one of the eight coords can retain all of the information of the banner

## Companies
Companies are formed to do many things. Companies may have a singular purpose, or might have many initiatives. For the average person, working for a company is the best hope for working under

## Blacklisting
There are no second chances in the guild system. Any entity found in legal violation of a Charter by a Guild Court is immediately blacklisted by that guild. Each guild has options for eventually working back into it's good graces, but often times entities that break guild contracts are not looking to do so. There is a word for those that have broken multiple Charters and as thus do their enterprising outside of the bounds of normal society - pirate.

# Expeditionary Guild
As the Cataclysm has receded and the seas around Velafia have begun to open up, many new lands have begun to reveal their riches. The main task of the Expeditionary Guild is to chart these new lands and the prospects that they may hold. Life in expedition companies is rarely boring - most new lands contain a healthy mix of natural resources, buried treasure, and dangerous wilderness. The risk is high, but for those willing to take it, the profits can be immense. 

## Benefits of the Charter
### Claims
- The Expeditionary Charter allows the discovering party to claim new lands and resources.
- The claim process is such:
    - Upon return from an expedition, the claimant can submit their charter for review by the guild.
    - If, after one month's time has elapsed since the opening of the review, there are no claimants that supersede the charter of the original claimant, then the claimant is granted the claim to that land / resource.
- Claim of a land entitles:
    - The right to charge fees for settling on that land
    - The right to charge land owners on said land a 5% annual tax on the value of the land. The value of the land must be negotiated at the time of sale, and can be re-negotiated at a time which not be less than three years but must not exceed six years.
    - A right to tax 1% earnings on the profits garnered by any resources discovered on the land, in perpetuity.
- Claim of a resource entitles:
    - A right to tax 5% earnings on the profits garnered by any resources discovered on the land, in perpetuity.
    - If the resource in question is sentient, then appropriate compensation must be reached with authority in command of that resource.
- For a claim to remain valid, it must be enforced by the following standards.
    - At at least a yearly interval, the claimant must provide a reasonable means of tax collection for the inhabitants of their claim. This may be mediated by a third party.

### Other benefits
- Claimants can sell their claims to legal state entities, and not have to worry about all those rules above.
- Those with an expeditionary charter may deduct 50% of all treasure from the taxes on treasure imposed by other claimant or states.

## Restrictions on the Expeditionary Charter
- Those under the Expeditionary Charter may not initiate hostile actions with members of any other guild or legal state.

# Privateer Guild
Paying others to fight for you is an enduring need of states. The Privateer guild provides whoever wishes to hire them with just such an option.

## Benefits of the Charter
- A privateer is allowed to accept contracts from a state to engage in hostile actions meant to hinder the abilities of another state.
- A privateer is entitled to deduct 50% the value of a ship before acquisition taxes are applied. This does not include the value of the ship itself, or of the ship's crew.
- A privateer may accept contracts to protect another entity, and may preemptively engage in hostile actions to protect that entity, so long as they can provide definitive proof of malice towards the protected entity in question.

## Prohibited Actions / Restrictions
- A privateer must accept the legitimate surrender of any who gives it.
- A privateer only has rights to the goods of captured vessels, not the vessel itself or the vessel's crew.

# Merchant Guild
Merchants are the life-blood of the Velafian economy. As one of the initial guilds to sign the compact, they have been operating in Velafia for nearly 55 years. Great merchant companies have build up via moving goods from one place to another to be bought and sold. Merchants enjoy enhanced protections at sea. The Merchant Guild provides insurance on most crews and cargos for most routes. Keep in mind that this provides a very different level of assurance for merchant companies (who might be reconciled for the loss of a valuable cargo and crew) and merchant sailors (who, in the same circumstance, might be take as slaves).

## Benefits of the Charter
- Merchant vessels do not pay port taxes
- Merchant tradesmen may by goods at with a tax determined by the merchant guild, not the state in which the transaction takes place.
- Merchant vessels are not obligated to assist vessels fly a distress signal.  
### Action against guild ships
- It is illegal to cause wanton destruction of merchant ships, such that they lose both life and cargo.
- Privateer ships alone are permitted to use force to subdue a merchant ship and re-direct it to a new port, given that the crew is not harmed post the surrender of the merchant ship, and no cargo is removed by the privateer in question.
  
## Prohibited actions
- Merchants may not initiate hostile actions with any entity for any reason.
- Merchant vessels cannot take another vessel under tow, except with the explicit consent of the ranking officer on the ship in question.

# Mages Guild
In the sense of the guilds, the main function of the mages guild is to maintain the system of banners and communication between different lands. To do so, they have several fortresses positioned throughout Velafia. Outside of the guild structure, each fortress maintains its individual mission to train mages in the schools of magic as they see fit.  
   
Mage Charters are different than most other charters. Mages are almost never allowed to leave a fortress without a charter. In addition, their charters are typically smaller in size, and are displayed as a symbol on their clothing. Unlike other charters (which mearly provide legal protection), a Mage's Charter magically compels the Mage to follow the laws of that charter.

## Benefits of the Charter
- They are the only ones legally allowed to
    - read banners
    - make new banners
    - scry the location of a banner
    - decommission a banner
- Mages can claim and sufficiently abnormal or unknown magical entities, locations, or persons, for further study by the Mages Guild.

## Restrictions
- Mages cannot use their power to directly affect the minds of sentient beings.
- Mages cannot use magic from the schools of Necromancy or Evocation
