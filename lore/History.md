# The general history of Velafia  
[images/Velafia_prestorm.png](images/Velafia_prestorm.png)
The history of Velafia can be broken into four ages
- Old Age (0 O.A. - 1263 O.A.) : The arrival of sentient beings to the continent. This age saw the construction of cities, but not proper states. This age ended with the century long rise and fall of the Galtian Empire.

- Age Before the Storm (A.B.S. 0 - A.B.S. 541). In this age cities coalesced in to city states and nation states. Culture identities solidified in geographic regions. This age ended with the Cataclysm.

- Isolation Age (I.A 0 - I.A - ) During this time, the surviving cities recovered from the Cataclysm, and began contact with each other when possible.

- Age of Reemergence (A.R. 0 - A.R. ) The current age of Velafia, in which the Cataclysm receded to the point that increased interaction with each other and with the rest of the world became possible once again.


## Prehistory
Very little is known about the history of Velafia before the elves. Archeologists have found evidence that civilizations existed without writing, or good records of events or the passage of time. It is unclear what species might have comprised these people's, since the elves that colonized Velafia only sub-sentient races incapable of building proper civilizations.

## Arrival of the Elves (0 O.A.)
According to the Eleves, the land of Velafia (Vanffia in Elven) was dormant until the !elves of the tribe of @vanifar, the prime speaker, settled the land. Long before humans spawned into the world, long before the dwarves made the great crossing, Vanffia was a serine and peaceful land where the the the followers of @vanifar were able to leave a clean life, mortal and in touch with nature, for with the help of the Elven god Unthyyidor they had rejected the cursed waters of immortality. Mortal and bound to mortal existence once again, the elves of Vanifar's tribe (who had been of High Elf decent) were even greeted as kin by the wood elves that arrived in 302 0.A.  
  
During this time, the elves explored the land, and built many cities and outposts. The elves lead a decentralized existence, and in the later period it was not uncommon for a band of settlers to travel to a new land, only to find that it had been settled by their kin generations before and simply fallen out of contact. The population of Velafian elves did not grow as much as one might think, since they were far happier to wander to new lands than to stay put and build the large cities. Still, their mark of the land cannot be underestimated. Even as late as 530 A.B.S. there are accounts of explorers uncovering elven settlements that had not had contact with the outside world for nearly 1,500 years.

## The comming of men (and dwarves and orcs)
Humans first began to settle Velafia in 548 O.A. The original human settlements formed on the northern coast after explorers from !Ranos reported that they had discovered a vast, fertile land. The settled land came to be known as !Alailios, and for the next hundred years saw a massive influx of Ranosian. At first, this influx was generated by the cheap and arable land in the !Takis basin. Later this influx was accelerated by the discovery of the !kiol plant.  

### The Kiol Plant
The !kiol plant is a low growing fern, with large green-brown striped leaves and blue stem. Around 580 O.A., the Alailian herbologist @Jyranon.Aniel discovered that the fibrous leaves of the plant were extremely good at retaining magical auras. She developed a method for weaving the fibers into cloth, and !kiol weave was quickly realized to be extremely useful in almost all applications of artefacing. After efforts to transport the !kiol plant back to Ranos for cultivation ended in failure, a mad rush to cultivate the plant was met with setbacks. !kiol turned out to be very difficult to grow, seeming to prefer the soil around the hotsprings. Further, prolonged exposure to wild !kiol plants had adverse effects on humans - @Jyranon.Aniel died after going insane from prolonged exposure to the fern.  

### The slave trade in Anailios
After the discovery that orcs, dwarves, and half breeds of those races with humans were far more resistant to the effects of !kiol, the demand grew for workers to be emigrated from Elaria. Though it was likely that the first orcs and dwarves to arrive in Velafia did so out of enterprising spirit, it was not long before slavers from !Gorodol saw the opportunity to make a fortune importing a workforce to Anailios. In short order, the wealth of Anailios that came from the export of !kiol meant that excess slaves could be afforded in all sorts of industries, such as farming and mining. By 660 O.A., the slave trade from Gorodol was importing nearly 3,000 slaves per year on massive fleets. Slavery is in the colonies did not sit well with the free states of Ranos, but at this point it was too late - the cities of Anailios were self sustaining, and more importantly, creating enough demand for food, resources, and !kiol that they could continue to import slaves. In 703 O.A., the cities of Anailios declared independence from Ranos, though in the model of their home nation they did not form a centralized government. In short order, trade even resumed between the Anailian cities and some states in Ranos. 

### Formation of the Andelian Freeholds
Relations between the Alailic people and the elves that inhabited the northern lands started off well, but the like the Ranosian's the Velafian Elves were opposed to the enslavement of sentient beings (note: this is a departure from the attitude of the High Elves of Elaria, who largely didn't practice slavery because "it was a bad look", and not because of moral opposition to it). After the beginning of the slave trade around 660 O.A. the high elves began to abandon towns and cities on the Alailic coast and migrate elsewhere under the leadership of the elf @Andel. When they did so, they took others with them - free orcs and dwarves, and even humans that were opposed to the slave trade. Though @Andel was old and died in 691 O.A., the free cities formed by this effort and after carried the general title of !Andelian Freehold.  
  
The most famous of the freehold are the cities of !Carelr and !Arilir on the island of !Saratosa. Initially, Alailians ignored Saratosa for settlement because of it's distance from the cities in the Takis Basin. Initially the people of Saratosa adopted a corsair raiding based lifestyle as a way of punishing Alainian slave shipments and bolstering their numbers by liberating would be slaves. As the slave shipments died down through the second half of the O.A. and into the A.B.S., the Saratosan city states expanded their raiding west and south, becoming both feared pirates and expert sailors.

### Other Colonization efforts during the Old Age
As word of Velafia spread throughout Elaria, various colonization efforts were made by different groups.
- Between 680 O.A. and 830 O.A., there were five colony flotillas of Tabaxi (Catfolk) that left from the region of Valanar. The first four set up cities in the region that they named !Cyrenacia, while the fifth was a large exodus that was fleeing the conquering of the Valanar region by human hordes.
- Halflings and dwarves from Eastern Elaria did venture to the east and southeast coast of Velafia, but they never flourished as they were frequently raided by slavers from Alailia. Later many of these communities flourished under the Galtic Empire.

### Expansion during the Old Age
Expansion throughout the Old Age was largely driven from costal colonies inland. By around 1000 O.A., the four major river basins of Velafia had been charted and settled. This was a period of rapid population growth driven by a surplus of space and food. By the formation of the Galtian Empire in 1146 O.A., each of the four basins contained several cities with around 100,000 residents, and many outlying towns and villages.  
  
The central step of Velafia, knowns as the !Agaza Steppe, was particularly devoid of specific colonization efforts throughout the Old Age. The Agaza Steppe is a wild land, inhabited by many dangerous creatures. Over time, dissidents and nomads from the surrounding river valleys began to form a nomadic tribe structure on the steppe, and in tern, began to launch incursions into the city states of the neighboring basins. Many of these nomadic groups were formed by escaped slaves from neighboring lands.

### The rise and fall of the Galtian Empire
The first coherent nation state of Velafia came from the Galtus basin. Though at this point there were significant populations of people around Velafia, nation states had not been common for several reasons. First is the lack of significant threats; though the land was wild, there was generally room to expand such that growth was not limited by another cultural group. Second, many settlers arrived in Velafia to escape the nation-state system of Elaria, and often saw it prudent to restrict governmental control to a single city. Third, the prevailing sentiment was that the best way to uncover more resources was through exploration unknown territory and subsequent cultivation. However, as the lands of Velafia filled up, and borders began to run into each other, these conditions changed.
  
In 1138 O.A. a the !Lahga Horde of the Agaza Steppe raided into the Galtus basin, sacking three of the four major cities - !Alarva, !Harbeld, and !Grundmond. The city of !Higar was able to rally and army to combat the Lahga Horde, and for five years the Galtian people fought back the invaders. This event not only demonstrated the need for a centralized form of security, but also unified the Galtian people as they struggled against a common foe. In 1143 O.A., the Kingdom of !Galtus was formed with the coronation of the first high king, @Jacar.Tiring I.   
  
The first Velafian experiment with centralized rule went poorly. @Jacar.Tiring was a compotent state builder, and worked quickly to consolidate the kingdom politically and economically. However, following his untimely and mysterious death only six years into his rule, rulers of Galtus were not so good at keeping things together. Though the history of Galtus is dense and complicated, it is easily summed up thus : in it's one hundred-twenty year existence, Galtus had seventeen kings/emperors. Though many different styles of rule and governance were attempted, they all followed essentially the same model - they fueled the growth and expansion of the empire by conquering new land. By the year 1256 O.A., the Empire of Galtus had direct control over the !Galtus and !Chaturi basins, had confederated the !Cyrenacian cities, and entered into an alliance with !Saratosa. However, after more than one hundred years of neglecting the internal well fare the Galtian Empire buckled under its own weight. After a brutal seven years of civil war, the capital city of !Higar was besieged and razed to the ground, and the Galtian Empire dissolved in to client states.  
  
However, the failed attempt at nation building prompted others to try to get it right. The power and dominance of the Galtian nationalism had been obvious, and sparked the hope in others around the continent that they could harness that power. The fall of the Galtian Empire marks the end of the Old Age because it represented a significant shift in the zeitgeist. It convinced many people to give nation building a chance, and therefore lead to the nation state structure that was in place during the Cataclysm. 

### !Demographics through the O.A.
When humans first arrived around 550 O.A., there the elves that they met estimated that there were around 70,000 elves living in Velafia, with a 6:1 split of High Elves to Wood Elves. The elves at the time admitted that this was almost certainly an under-estimate, acknowledging that there might have been large unknown elven population centers.
  
By 703 O.A. when Anailios delclared independence, the known population of Velafia was close to 300,000 humans. The population of known elves had grown to 75,000. There were around 70,000 orcs and 50,000 dwarves almost all of these being slaves in Anailian territories. There were probably around 20,000 members of other races as well.

At the rise of the Galtian Empire in 1143 O.A., Velafia contained about:
- 2.2 million humans
- 1.3 million orcs
- 900,000 dwarves
- 225,000 elves (now a 2:1 split of high-elves to wood elves)
- 850,000 tabaxi
- 200,000 halflings
- 200,000 gnomes
- 100,000 of other races

### !Demographics
In A.B.S 541, right before the Cataclysm, the population of Velafia had about quadrupled since the end of the Old Age to be:
- 9.3 million humans
- 5.5 million orcs
- 2.9 million dwarves
- 600,000 elves (now a 1:3 split of high-elves to wood elves)
- 3.3 million tabaxi
- 500,000 halflings
- 400,000 gnomes
- 200,000 of other races

## The Lost Years (Isolation Age)

### Demographics
At the end of the age of isolation, the the population had shrunk significantly. There is not an accurate count of the demographics at the end of the Age of Isolation.

## The Reemergence (Age of Reemergence)
In the present day, the population of Velafia has recovered to about half of what it was at the end of the Age Before the Storm
- 5.7 million humans
- 3.3 million orcs
- 3.0 million dwarves
- 410,000 elves (now a 1:3 split of high-elves to wood elves)
- 2.1 million tabaxi
- 300,000 halflings
- 250,000 gnomes
- 125,000 of other races
