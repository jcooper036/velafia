# The major cultures of old Velafia
To understand the modern cultures of Velafia, it is important to understand the nine major culture groups that pre-dated the Cataclysm. Though all people that come from the continent can be said to be "Velafian", there is no single culture that would call themselves that. Some things in this document reference things that are talked about in other documents, like History and Religions.

## Mechanics of cultures
You do not have to chose to play as a certain culture - but you can. They are here to give you a window in to the different peoples and systems that exist in this world. Keep in mind that these are brief summaries of the nearly 1,600 year existence of most of these groups. History can be viewed through many lenses, and it is fine to decide that your character was born and raised in one of these cultures, but wants to be the exact opposite of what its majority represents. Also, I don't often cover how minority groups would view these cultures, which might be interesting territory to explore.  
  
In terms of the game, this is how cultures work. A Recall Knowledge check concerning a specific culture has a DC of +5. If you are from that culture, you get +5 to your roll. That's it, it is just mean to simulate people from that culture likely knowing more about it. The following tome of text would suggest I put in way too much work for such a simple mechanic. Enjoy.

## A note on references
The references for each cultural group are really meant for names and visuals, but don't necessarily associate with values. 

# Alailic (A-lay-lik)
## Origin and Geography
The Alailic culture formed out of the settlers that came from Ranos and settled in Anailios, a nation in Souther Elaria. They were some of the first non-Elven people to inhabit the land, and set camp in the north of Velafia in the Takis Basin. They are the oldest cultural group in Velafia, and the origin for most of the expansionary cultures.

## Society
Alailic people value individual autonomy to a high degree. This can be seen in their original state structure, which acted as more of federated cities than a state. As such, they have always had trouble forming a strong sense of cultural unity. They are welcoming of outsiders, but also generally exploitive of minority groups. The general Alailic attitude is to consider one's own happiness first. They have a strong culture of "the ends justify the means," and as such are known for being duplicitous. Alailian see these traits as positive, since they believe that others waste too much time on empathy.  
  
The Alailic social structure has only two classes: slaves and freemen. Slaves are treated as property, and are not afforded individual rights. Freemen may own slaves and land, participate in mercantile trade, hold political office.

### Ancestry Mix
Alailians are mostly humans, orcs, and dwarves. In Alailian societies, orcs and dwarves are considered to be slave races. The Alailians have enslaved members of other races in the past, but they specifically believe orcs and dwarves to be only worthy of slave status. It is rare to find Alailian elves. Other races are present to some degree.

# Saratosan (Sar-a-tose-an)
## Origin and Geography
Saratosa is an island to the north of Anailios. Though many types of people settled here origionally, the modern Saratosans settled as freed / escaped slaves from Anailios, with the help of High Elves and Humans that were morally opposed to slavery.

## Society
When Andel lead the movement to free slaves from Anailios, they began by settling in large numbers in Saratosa. Though during this time most who were part of Andel's movement came through Saratosa, many set off to other lands to form the Andelian Freeholds (the people of which, as a result, are often also refered to as Saratosan, thought they have little cultural ties with Saratosa itself). Through the Elven knowledge of magic and architecture, they began to quickly build costal cities. During this time, the Saratosan people took to the sea as corsairs, but only to raid the slave shipments that came from Elaria, and otherwise free captive peoples. They developed maritime traditions and customs, and as the cities of Anilios were not strongly unified, they were not able to build a navy that could sufficiently challenge the Saratosan raiders.  
  
As the Age Before the Storm wore on, the population of Saratosan cities boomed with new slaves (and serfs) escaping nearby lands. This came to the point that the Saratosan land and seas were not able to support the population, and starvation became rampant. As such, the more lawless of Saratosan corsairs began to target shipments of food, and then shipments of other goods to acquire money to trade for shipments of food. Because this solved the problem of food shortages, the Saratosan governments more or less looked the other way. Eventually, Saratosan cities started to pay premiums for food from any source, and a system of state sponsored piracy was born. The Saratosan cities, therefore, are not particularly well liked by Alailian and Krostean peoples - though historically, they have had little capability to challenge Saratosan naval dominance.  
  
In Saratosan society, all people are considered free citizens. It is illegal to own another sentient being as property, or to press someone into service for improper compensation. The Saratosan people justify much of their plundering ways with an argument akin to that they are stealing from slavers and oppressors. It is not uncommon for the most ruthless of Saratosan corsairs to stand by this conviction by offering the crews of captured ships a life as free people in Saratosan lands.
## Ancestry Mix
The Saratosan people are mostly High Elves, Orcs, Humans, and Wood Elves. Though many dwarves originally escaped from Anailios in Andel's movement, they are not fond of the sea, and were quick to migrate to the other freeholds. Given their commitment to individual freedom, the less common races feel more at ease in Saratosan culture as well.

# Krostea (Koss-tee-a)
## Origin and Geography
Krostea is situated on the north east corner of Velafia. Before and during the expansion, it became a favorite destination of wealthy settlers looking to build a life away from the politics of Anailios. The trend was for someone with lots of money to commission a group of settlers to set out into the Krostean wilderness and set down a castle on a suitable piece of land. As more and more would be lords started to stake out claims, wealthy nobles came together and put forth the Writ of Stewardship, giving their council adjucation over all further settlement east of the Gitur Moutains and north of the Vunkal Mountains.

## Society
Krostean society is feudal, with a lord, who's title is inherited by birth (though different petty kingdoms have different systems for this), reigning over their subjects. In this, all land belongs to the lord. There are three classes in Krostea, lords, nobles, and serfs. The semantic difference between serf and slave does little to change the day to day life of most Krosteans; they work, leisure, and ultimately live at the behest of their lord. Lord's come together once and a while to resign the Writ, in which they all pledge to protect the land and it's people, to which end no one can own it except them. As one might imagine, the life of a Krostean lord is posh.  
  
Unlike most other cultures where the city is the geographic center of trade and politics, Krosteans tend to rely on castles. This has an effect that most petty kingdoms are perfectly self sustaining, but have trouble producing a surplus of food or trade goods such that their populations are able to thrive. Though this decentralized nature seems like it would make the Krostean lands ripe for conquest, the Krostean lords take the Writ very seriously. On numerous occasions, truces have been signed on the battlefield between two Krostean enemies upon word that their feud is being exploited by a non-Krostean outsider. Due to the need to defend themselves from outsiders and other Krostean lords, the Krostean petty kingdoms are highly militaristic.  
  
Krostean nobles are a small class (though maybe ten times as numerous as the lords), made up of promoted serfs that enjoy some of the privileges of the lord class. Nobles are picked from serfs that are deemed sufficiently impressive, and typically serve as knights, commanders, administrators, treasures - basically anything that is not the fun part of ruling a kingdom. Unlike lord status, nobility cannot be inherited, something that the Writ of Stewardship makes very clear. The unfortunate reality is that the children of nobles stand less of a chance of being promoted to the nobility themselves, as to avoid any would be dynasties from emerging. 
## Ancestry Mix
Kostean lords are typically human. Krostean nobles and serfs are a wide mix of ancestries. It is not uncommon for talented outsiders to be paid to join a Krostean court and live as a noble.

# Chaturta (Sha-tur-tah)
## Origin and Geography
Nestled in the center of Eastern Velafia, the Chaturta homelands are mostly hot, humid rainforests. The land of this region is extremely fertile, and nearly everything that is planted can grow here. This is both a blessing and a curse - food is easy to come by, but not easy to cultivate in large farms. Most of the people that have come to Chaturta and stayed did simply because they did not want to go back to where they came from. It is the least densely populated of all regions in Velafia.

## Society
The Chaturta culture has three distinct groups of the rural, urban, and lizard varieties. The unifying bond between them is a unique religion that adds three major gods which most Chaturta worship. When the sentient races first came to Chaturtra (which means "the Middle Land" in the lizard tongue), they struggled to make use of the land. At every turn, they were defeated by the jungle, which would consume everything they tried to build without constant maintenance. Slowly, settlers became acquainted with the Lizardfolk. Eventually they realized that the Lizardfolk were not the sub-sentient race that the Elves had first believed them to be, but instead deeply in tune with the jungle and it's ways. The Lizardfolk taught the other races how to live alongside the jungle, and work with the jungle to meet common goals. Along with this came the Lizardfolk Region, the Tepleu Raxa-Caculha (Way of Jungle Life), and the worship of three new gods : Wayeb (God of the Jungle), Pukuh (God of the Waters) and Oxlahuntiku (God of Prophecy).

## Rural Chaturta
Rural Chaturta people are easy going, and generally laid back. They live in dispersed groups around the territory, with no major cities. Though individuals work hard to cultivate and maintain small towns and villages, they are collectively not a very productive people. The Chaturtan's have a contentment that comes with having found their place in the world. They are excellent jungle explorers, guides, beast tamers, and herbalists. They spend much of their lives in a mixture of subsiding off the land and searching the jungle for it's many treasures.

## Urban Chaturta
Urban Chaturta are a mercantile folk. Since the early days of Chaturtan settlement, the Chaturan cities have served as a haven for travelers making their way up and down the Eastern Velafian coast. These cities learned to thrive off of business with these travelers, and in time, they built navies to patrol their costal waters and ward of pirates. However, they maintain a close tie to the many inland settlements, and though they practice a hybrid of the Tepleu Raxa-Caculha and worship to the Elarian Pantheon, they are most known for their daily prayer to Pukuh.

## Lizardfolk Chaturta
When the Elves first came to Velafia, they did not consider the Lizardfolk to be full sentient creatures. This is perhaps because it took some time for the Elves (and other races too), to make contact with the Chaturtan Lizardfolk. The Lizardfolk have a much broader spectrum of intelligence than most races, and are on average, not very bright. However, among them there are brilliant minds by the standard of any race. The Lizardfolk have a society where they attempt to find a purpose for all members, bright or dull, as the Tepleu Raxa-Caculha dictates. They have a unique gift for prophecy and divination, which they consider to be the divine blessing of Oxlahuntiku. They understand the magical uses of Velafian plants and wildlife better than any other race in Velafia. However, they live only in their temple cities of Chaturta, as they are best suited to the heat and humidity that is enough to make other races miserable.

## Ancestry Mix
The Chaturta are primarily Elves, Lizardfolk, Gnomes, and Halflings. The heat and humidity has never been suitable for humans, and especially dwarves - most of whom feel fatigues in the environment.

# Hartusian (Ya-rind-ii)

## Origin and Geography
The Hartusian society is the newest in Velafia. While most places call back to their pre-Cataclysm cultural heritage, the Hartusian have purposefully erased theirs to start anew. They come from the city of Miyor-Yarind, on the island of Hartuse in Easter Velafia. Miyor-Yarind was established in 534 A.B.S. as a haven for members of the Yarindi religion fleeing persecution in other regions of the world. The name Hartusian is used to serve as a way to separate the Yarindi that come from Hartuse itself verus those that follow the faith but come from elsewhere in Velafia.

## Society
Hartusian society is heavily interlinked with the Yarindi religion and the state that is Miyor-Yarind. People from this society have an extreme sense of devotion to the Yarindi demi-god Bethalos, and follow his teachings closely. They are an extremely communal and meritocratic people, believing strongly in personal destiny. In this society, marriage is a construct of the state to enable breeding programs targeted at producing the optimal workforce.  
  
Other than constant adherence to religious doctrine , the strangest aspect of Hartusian society (wait and that there is no family structure, and that children are taken from their parents at birth (well people don't really decide to have kids, kids more of come from breeding farms) and that from an early age their life is constant stream of religious dogma) is the organization of social classes. The Hartusians believe that every single being is born a slave to Bethalos, and only by serving his vision in this life do you gain freedom in the next life. The only source of personal autonomy in Hartusian society rests within the clergy, who gifted with the ability to interpret the will of Bethalos. Clergy are chosen via divination by the existing clergy. Though this may sound obviously self serving to most other societies, observers of Harusian society have not been able to identify a pattern by which new clergy members are chosen, indicating that the process is at the very least, equitable. Along with this religious and sociatal devotion, Hartusians have a strong distaste for anything supernatural that is not obviously tied to Bethalos.

## Ancestry Mix
Yarindi are a blend of most ancestries, and as such humans (while still common) are less prevalent in their society than in others.

# Betular (Bet-u-lar)
## Origin and Geography
Betular culture and society solidified during the expansionary period of the Old Age, when explorers discovered large quantities of !kiol in the !Laka Basin. Initial the Betular residents were immigrants from Alailic lands, but as time passed the wealth promised by harvesting !kiol attracted people from many regions.
## Society
The Laka basin is much more mountainous than the Takis or Galtan basins, and as such the Betular people were much more concentrated in cities than in other regions. Several of these cities attracted large number of mages, who sought to set up shop close to the kiol source. Over time, three Betular cities developed into mage strongholds - Lagi, Kanoa, and Iram, where similar named Orders of Magic began. These orders formed close ties with the Betular people, providing them with many wonders that serve their every-day lives. As such, the Betular people are much more comfortable with magic. Unlike other societies where magic and mages are seen as something to be approached cautiously at best, the Betular people welcome magic practitioners, both domestic and foreign. Mages are allowed and encouraged to hold political office in most Betular states, whereas such activity is prohibited by law in most other places.  
  
The Betular cities were subjugated by the Galtan Empire between 1169 O.A. and 1202 O.A. During this time, the Galtan Empire made the path to citizenship very difficult for the Betular people. Though most Betular were allowed to live as freemen, the restriction from holding office meant that even the leaders of most towns were appointed by the Galtan Empire. The Empire did little to dissuade Betulan dissidents - they routinely enforced quotas of food, goods, and slaves to be sent to the Galtan homelands, and forced marriages between Galtan and Betulan people as a means of cultural integration. In the later years of the occupation, the Galtan Empire decided to make an example of the Kanoa Order by razing it's stronghold. This broke the uneasy truce that the empire had built with the Mage Orders, and they joined the Betular people in open rebellion. This may not have been enough to drive off the Galtan Legions, except that the Empire was crumbling from infighting among powerful generals/warlords as well. During the Age Before the Storm, it took the Betulan people sometime to let go of their mistrust of the Galtan people - to this day, they still few the Galtan as arrogant and entitled.  
  
During the Age Before the Storm, Betulan society flourished as the Lagi and Iram Orders became renowned across Velafia. Eventually they fused into the Lagiram Order. The close ties between the Betulan cities, the Lagiram Order, and the Lagiram mages with many courts of Velafia means that Betulan cities have remained important political powers all over Velafia, despite having relatively small populations, armies, or trade goods.  
  
Betulan society is not as stratified as other societies, with most people living as citizens capable of holding land and office. They do prize intelligence above all else, and they prioritize the opinions of those with magical capabilities. Due to their history with the Galtan Empire, most Betulan societies do not bar free individuals from holding office, regardless of birth or economic status. Betular cultures do practice slavery, but due to their ties with the Lagiram order they have a much lesser need of manual labor than most other regions. Instead, slaves in Betular cultures are more often house-servants. Most slaves in Betular cultures end up as slaves through indentured servitude, rather than by force.
  
## Ancestry Mix
The Betular people are highly mixed. High Elves and halflings are more common among the Betular than among most cultures. Dwarves, being inherently resistent to magic, are not as common.

# Galtan (Gall-tan)
## Origin and Geography
The Galtus basin was originally settled by a mixture of most races. Over the expansion period of the O.A., these people gravitated toward four Elven strongholds. In a similar parallel to Alailia, these settlers brought slaves with them, eventually leading to most elves emigrating away from the valley. However, the Galtian people system of slavery was very different from that of the Alialians. Where as in Alialian cities slavery was largely based on race (dwarves and orcs)

## Society
The Galtan people are ambitious and enterprising. When the expansion was underway, Galtan was settled by the people who dared to travel further than everyone else. However, this same vigor leads to a general dis-satisfaction with life among the Galtan people. They always believe that someone around them could be doing better, be it their family, their state, or themselves.  
  
Galtans place a strong emphasis on family structure, with the central figures being the patriarch and matriarch. They have a ridged gender structure, and believe that men are best at matters of the body and decisions, while women are best at matters of the mind and contemplation. The Galtans often have this duality to their writing and art, with the most well known Galtan literature written as conversations between a man and a woman discussing matters of the family, the state, or life in general.  
  
Galtian societies usually operate on a caste system, divided into four categories : slaves, tribesmen, freemen, and citizens. One of the enuring legacies of the Galtan Empire is that, even in places that do not follow this caste system, the social/political status of individuals is generally compared to what status they would hold in the Galtan Empire. Castes are determined by birth, and the caste ladder can be ascended and descended by economic status or declaration of the state.
    - Galtian slaves cannot own property or barter with goods or currency. However, they are afforded many legal protections. Restriction from bartering means that in most places, slaves are not expected to pay for anything.
    - Galtian tribesmen are allowed to barter, but are not allowed to own land or slaves. The tribesmen status usually refers to quasi-civilized peoples that live near Galtian populations. The Galtian form of consolidation was to appease these peoples by giving them rights and legal protection, but to prevent them from owning slaves such as to stop them from abducting proper Galtians. 
    - Galtian freemen can barter and own slaves, but not own land. Most people living in Galtian societies are considered freemen. They typically rent land from the citizenry. It is not uncommon for Galtian freemen to own slaves.
    - Galtian citizens can barter, own slaves, and own land. This might not be a surprise, but the ability to own land is what helps cement their status at the top tier of society and prevents them from falling into economic ruin. A typical Galtian citizen usually has many slaves under their employ, though some take a more distributed approach to running their estates in which they contract freemen to hire slaves. Importantly, citizens are the only caste that can hold political office. In order to become a citizen, one must receive an official declaration from the state. This usually comes only after high tier education, service in the military, and the prospect of acquiring land.

## Ancestry Mix
Galtians come from all ancestries. They do not practice race-based slavery, and do not see any race as inherently superior or inferior to others. As such, there are more human slaves and dwarf / orc citizens than one might find in an Alailian society. The only ancestry that is lacking in Galtian societies is Elves, since like many societies, they usually left as settlers arrived.

# Cyrenacian (Ky-ren-ay-ki-an) or (Sy-ren-ay-si-an), depending on where you are from
## Origin and Geography
The region of Cyrenacia spans the much of western Velafia. Cyrenacia is an arid land, with some regions of outright desert. It was first largely settled by the Tabaxi who immigrated and late fled from Western Elaria. Since then then there has been a steady influx of people from all over Velafia that have come to settle here. 

## Society
Cyrenacian society is centered around the Basili (plural of Basilius (Bas-il-i-us)), quasi-reglious warlord merchant phliosopher kings, who are as varied as their decription might suggest. Basili come from all walks of life - they might be a popular general, a prominent scholar, a wealthy businessman, a self styled prophet, or really, anything that afords them a following. They are enabled by the belief of Cyrenacian society that laws are not suited to contain the boldest, brightest, and holiest minds. Basili then use this following to attempt and seize political, military, and economic control of institutions. For the non-Basili majority of Cyrenacians, they devote themself to the clan of a Basilus that they find worthy. Because the identity of the clan is ultimately tied to the life of one individual, Cyrenacian politics essentially boilds down to who get's the followers when a Basilus dies.  
  
Though the cycle of devotion to an individual does not make for a particularlly stable political strucutre, the constraints placed upon the Basili have allowed Cyrenacian soceities to prosper. Basili are expected to be wise, honorable, thoughtful, and enduring. The Cyrenacians place a strong emphasis on history - it is their belief that the last Basilus will be the one that can see both into the past and future, and hold the lessons of all their predicesors at once. In such a manner, Cyrenacian society is albe to float between dedication to a Basilius and cult like devotion.  
  
The structure of the Cyrenacian citizenry depends entirely on what Basilus they follow. This leads to strange situations, when different Basili are competing for governence of a city. The Cyrenacian people have learned, better than others, to live with this sort of cognitive dissodence, fueled by the belief that they will eventually find their once and future King.

## Ancestry Mix
Most Tabaxi in Velafia live in Cyrenacian cultures. Humans, Wood Elves, and orcs are also plentiful. Other races are present too, but not in as high of numbers.

# Unur-Ken (un-ur-kehn)
## Origin and Geography
The high plains of the Anysus Plateu is the central most region of Velafia. Located between all the major mountain ranges, this region is supprisingly cool compared to the rest of the continent. The people that settled his orgioninally were esacaped slaves from Anailios and Galtan.

## Society
The Unur-Ken is a fusion of the dwarf clan system and the orc nomadic tribes of Elaria. They have been unable to sucessfully cultivate large segments of land and build cities, largely owning the rocky, grassy terrain, and lack of major water sources. They instead wander the planes, following large herds of game. To the rest of Velafia they are seen as nomadic raiders, and barbaians. The Unur-Ken see the open sky and the harsh ground of their homeland. Though they follow gods of the Elarian Pantheon, they are primarily worshipers of Gorum and Gozreh, and consider them to be the two makers above all the other gods.  
  
Unur-Ken society revovles around tribes and their chieftans. Terriotory is not such a concept as ownship of a herd of game. Raids of other civilizations generally occur when tribes are pushed to the edge of the Anysus plains and no longer able to hunt game, or, as was the case with the invasion of Galtan, the consolodation of tribes under a single, powerful warlord. Though former slaves, Unur-Ken have no qualms about enslaving others - though it is sacrilidge to enslave members of one's own tribe. At times, powerful chieftans have controlled enough territory to allow for caravans to pass between the surrounding nations. However, these deals nearly always fall appart when that chieften is replaced or they simply decide it's time for a raid.

## Ancestry Mix
Unur-Ken are the largest population of Orcs and Dwarves in Velafia. Wood elves and gnomes are not uncommon. Humans are rare, as they are generally mistrusted by the Unur-Ken.

# Elarian
After the recession of the Cataclysm, trade slowly restarted between Velafia and Elaria. This means that small groups of people from Elaria can be found throughout Velafia.
