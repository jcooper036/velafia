# The major cultures of old Velafia
To understand the modern cultures of Velafia, it is important to understand the five major culture groups that pre-dated the Cataclysm. Though all people that come from the continent can be said to be "Velafian", there is no single culture that would call themselves that.

### A note on references
The references for each cultural group are really meant for names and visuals, but don't necessarily associate with values. 

## Alailic (A-lay-lik)
### Origin and Geography
The Alailic culture formed out of the settlers that came from Ranos, a nation in Souther Elaria. They were some of the first non-Elven people to inhabit the land, and set camp in the north of Velafia in the Takis Basin. They are the oldest cultural group in Velafia, and the origin for most of the expansionary cultures.

### Society
Alailic people value individual autonomy to a high degree. This can be seen in their original state structure, which acted as more of federated cities than a state. As such, they have always had trouble forming a strong sense of cultural unity. They are welcoming of outsiders, but also generally exploitive of minority groups. The general Alailic attitude is to consider one's own happiness first. They have a strong culture of "the ends justify the means," and as such are known for being duplicitous. Alailian see these traits as positive, since they believe that others waste too much time on empathy.  
  
The Alailic social structure has only two classes: slaves and freemen. Slaves are treated as property, and are not afforded individual rights. Freemen may own slaves and land, participate in mercantile trade, hold political office.

### Ancestry Mix
Alailians are mostly humans, orcs, and dwarves. In Alailian societies, orcs and dwarves are considered to be slave races. The Alailians have enslaved members of other races in the past, but they specifically believe orcs and dwarves to be only worthy of slave status. It is rare to find Alailian elves. Other races are present to some degree.

## Hartusian (Ya-rind-ii)

### Origin and Geography
The Hartusian society is the newest in Velafia. While most places call back to their pre-Cataclysm cultural heritage, the Hartusian have purposefully erased theirs to start anew. They come from the city of Miyor-Yarind, on the island of Hartuse in Easter Velafia. Miyor-Yarind was established in 534 A.B.S. as a haven for members of the Yarindi religion fleeing persecution in other regions of the world. The name Hartusian is used to serve as a way to separate the Yarindi that come from Hartuse itself verus those that follow the faith but come from elsewhere in Velafia.

### Society
Hartusian society is heavily interlinked with the Yarindi religion and the state that is Miyor-Yarind. People from this society have an extreme sense of devotion to the Yarindi demi-god Bethalos, and follow his teachings closely. They are an extremely communal and meritocratic people, believing strongly in personal destiny. In this society, marriage is a construct of the state to enable breeding programs targeted at producing the optimal workforce.  
  
Other than constant adherence to religious doctrine , the strangest aspect of Hartusian society (wait and that there is no family structure, and that children are taken from their parents at birth (well people don't really decide to have kids, kids more of come from breeding farms) and that from an early age their life is constant stream of religious dogma) is the organization of social classes. The Hartusians believe that every single being is born a slave to Bethalos, and only by serving his vision in this life do you gain freedom in the next life. The only source of personal autonomy in Hartusian society rests within the clergy, who gifted with the ability to interpret the will of Bethalos. Clergy are chosen via divination by the existing clergy. Though this may sound obviously self serving to most other societies, observers of Harusian society have not been able to identify a pattern by which new clergy members are chosen, indicating that the process is at the very least, equitable. Along with this religious and sociatal devotion, Hartusians have a strong distaste for anything supernatural that is not obviously tied to Bethalos.

### Ancestry Mix
Yarindi are a blend of most ancestries, and as such humans (while still common) are less prevalent in their society than in others.

## Galtan (Gall-tan)
### Origin and Geography
The Galtus basin was originally settled by a mixture of most races. Over the expansion period of the O.A., these people gravitated toward four Elven strongholds. In a similar parallel to Alailia, these settlers brought slaves with them, eventually leading to most elves emigrating away from the valley. However, the Galtian people system of slavery was very different from that of the Alialians. Where as in Alialian cities slavery was largely based on race (dwarves and orcs)

### Society
The Galtan people are ambitious and enterprising. When the expansion was underway, Galtan was settled by the people who dared to travel further than everyone else. However, this same vigor leads to a general dis-satisfaction with life among the Galtan people. They always believe that someone around them could be doing better, be it their family, their state, or themselves.  
  
Galtans place a strong emphasis on family structure, with the central figures being the patriarch and matriarch. They have a ridged gender structure, and believe that men are best at matters of the body and decisions, while women are best at matters of the mind and contemplation. The Galtans often have this duality to their writing and art, with the most well known Galtan literature written as conversations between a man and a woman discussing matters of the family, the state, or life in general.  
  
Galtian societies usually operate on a caste system, divided into four categories: slaves, tribesmen, freemen, and citizens. Castes are determined by birth, and the caste ladder can be ascended and descended by economic status or declaration of the state.
    - Galtian slaves cannot own property or barter with goods or currency. However, they are afforded many legal protections. Restriction from bartering means that in most places, slaves are not expected to pay for anything.
    - Galtian tribesmen are allowed to barter, but are not allowed to own land or slaves. The tribesmen status usually refers to quasi-civilized peoples that live near Galtian populations. The Galtian form of consolidation was to appease these peoples by giving them rights and legal protection, but to prevent them from owning slaves such as to stop them from abducting proper Galtians. 
    - Galtian freemen can barter and own slaves, but not own land. Most people living in Galtian societies are considered freemen. They typically rent land from the citizenry. It is not uncommon for Galtian freemen to own slaves.
    - Galtian citizens can barter, own slaves, and own land. This might not be a surprise, but the ability to own land is what helps cement their status at the top tier of society and prevents them from falling into economic ruin. A typical Galtian citizen usually has many slaves under their employ, though some take a more distributed approach to running their estates in which they contract freemen to hire slaves. Importantly, citizens are the only caste that can hold political office. In order to become a citizen, one must receive an official declaration from the state. This usually comes only after high tier education, service in the military, and the prospect of acquiring land.

### Ancestry Mix
Galtians come from all ancestries. They do not practice race-based slavery, and do not see any race as inherently superior or inferior to others. As such, there are more human slaves and dwarf / orc citizens than one might find in an Alailian society. The only ancestry that is lacking in Galtian societies is Elves, since like many societies, they usually left as settlers arrived.
